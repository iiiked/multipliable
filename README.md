# tp-multipliable

Hi coders, today you will need to write a function `multipliable` that will take three STRING arguments, two will represent alphabetical letters A...Z and the last one a result. Example: `('AB', 'AB', '100')`, Each letter represents unique single-digit number 0...9. You will need to return `true` or `false` depending on whether multiplying those composed numbers will give you a result.

For example,
```
multipliable('AB', 'AB', '100'); // true

// because 10 * 10 === 100
```

### Flow...
* Fork this repo
* Clone it to your machine
* Run `npm install` from local repository folder
* Solve problem in `index.js`
* Run `npm test` and if OK, add, commit and push it to your github
* Make a pull request

### Extra credit
If you feel it was too easy, go to `index.test.js` and try uncommenting extra credit test:
```
multipliable('CODEWORKS', 'AWESOME', '957443700165410') // true
```

### Good Luck!
